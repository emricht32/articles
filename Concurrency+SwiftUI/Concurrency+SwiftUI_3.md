## Part 3: Real-World Example

In this part of our tutorial, we will build a sample app that uses Concurrency and SwiftUI to fetch data from an API and display it in a user-friendly way. We will also discuss best practices for using Concurrency in combination with SwiftUI, and provide additional resources for learning more.

### Project Setup

First, let's create a new Xcode project and select the SwiftUI App template. For this example, we will be building an app that displays a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. The app will have two screens: a list of posts, and a detail screen for each post.

### Networking with Concurrency

To fetch data from the API, we will use the `URLSession` class with Concurrency. Let's create a NetworkManager class that will handle our network requests:

```swift
class NetworkManager { 
  private let session: URLSession 
  init() { 
    let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default 
    configuration.timeoutIntervalForResource = 30 
    session = URLSession(configuration: configuration) 
  } 
  func getPosts() async throws -> [Post] { 
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")! 
    let (data, _) = try await session.data(from: url) 
    return try JSONDecoder().decode([Post].self, from: data) 
  } 
}
```

This class has a `getPosts()` method that fetches a list of posts from the API. We use the async keyword to indicate that this method is asynchronous, and we use the await keyword to wait for the network request to complete before returning the result.
SwiftUI Views
Now let's create our SwiftUI views. We'll start with the PostListView:

```swift
struct PostListView: View { 
  @StateObject private var viewModel = PostListViewModel() 
  var body: some View { 
    NavigationView { 
      List(viewModel.posts, id: \.id) { post in NavigationLink(destination: PostDetailView(post: post)) { 
        VStack(alignment: .leading) { 
          Text(post.title) 
          	.font(.headline) 
          Text(post.body) 
          	.font(.subheadline) 
        } 
      }
    } 
    .navigationTitle("Posts") 
    } 
    .task { 
      do { 
        try await viewModel.fetchPosts() 
      } catch { 
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)") 
      } 
    } 
  } 
} 

class PostListViewModel: ObservableObject { 
  @Published var posts = [Post]() 
  private let networkManager = NetworkManager() 
  func fetchPosts() async throws { 
    posts = try await networkManager.getPosts() 
  } 
}
```

In this view, we use the `@StateObject` property wrapper to create a PostListViewModel, which will handle fetching the list of posts from the API. We use the `.task` modifier to run the `fetchPosts()` method asynchronously when the view appears. If an error occurs, we simply print the error to the console.
The PostListViewModel class has a `fetchPosts()` method that uses our NetworkManager class to fetch the list of posts from the API. When the request is complete, we update the posts property of the view model, which triggers an update of the UI.
Next, let's create the PostDetailView:

```swift
struct PostDetailView: View { 
  let post: Post 
  var body: some View { 
    VStack(alignment: .leading) { 
      Text(post.title) 
      .font(.headline) 
      Text(post.body) 
      .font(.subheadline)
    } 
    .padding() 
    .navigationTitle(post.title) 
  } 
}
```

This view simply displays the details of a single post. We pass in a Post object when creating the view, and use its properties to display the post title and body.

### Putting it all Together

Now that we have our views and networking code, let's put them together in our app. We'll modify the ContentView to show the PostListView:

```swift
struct ContentView: View { 
  var body: some View {
    PostListView() 
  } 
}
```

And that's it! Run the app and you should see a list of posts. Tapping on a post will take you to the detail view for that post.

### Best Practices

When using Concurrency with SwiftUI, it's important to follow some best practices to make your code more robust and maintainable:
1. Separate concerns: Split your code into small, reusable components that have a single responsibility. For example, our NetworkManager class handles network requests, while our view models handle the business logic of fetching and updating data.
2. Keep your code readable: Use descriptive names for your variables and functions, and structure your code in a way that makes it easy to read and understand.
3. Avoid common pitfalls: Be aware of common pitfalls when using Concurrency, such as deadlocks, race conditions, and resource leaks. Use Swift's built-in tools, such as `@MainActor` and `@TaskLocal`, to avoid these issues.
4. Test your code: Write unit tests to ensure that your code works as expected, and to catch bugs early.
