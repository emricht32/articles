# SwiftUI and the Concurrency framework

Welcome to this three-part tutorial series on using the Concurrency framework with SwiftUI. In this series, we'll explore the basics of concurrency in Swift and how we can use it with SwiftUI to build high-performance apps.

Concurrency is a crucial aspect of modern app development, as it enables us to run multiple tasks simultaneously and efficiently utilize available system resources. The Concurrency framework in Swift provides a set of powerful tools that allow us to manage the complexities of concurrent programming.

In the first part of this tutorial series, we'll start by introducing the basics of concurrency and explore how to use the URLSession API to make network requests. We'll also learn about the different types of queues and how they are used to manage the execution of tasks.

In the second part, we'll dive deeper into how concurrency can be used in SwiftUI to build responsive and performant user interfaces. We'll learn how to use async/await and Swift's new concurrency features to perform long-running tasks in the background and update the UI on the main thread.

Finally, in the third part, we'll explore a real-world example that showcases the power of concurrency and SwiftUI in action. We'll build a simple app that retrieves data from an API and displays it in a list, all while leveraging the concurrency framework to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.

Whether you're new to concurrency or an experienced developer looking to learn more about how it can be used with SwiftUI, this tutorial series has something for you. So, let's get started and learn how to build powerful and responsive apps with Swift and the Concurrency framework!

## Part 1: Introduction to Concurrency and Networking with URLSession

In this part, we will cover the basics of Concurrency and how to use URLSession to perform network requests in a SwiftUI app. We will start by discussing what Concurrency is, why it's important, and how it works. Then, we will move on to setting up a basic network request, handling responses and errors with Concurrency's async/await syntax, and working with data in SwiftUI views.

### What is Concurrency?

Concurrency is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, or at the same time. This can improve the performance and responsiveness of an app, especially when dealing with time-consuming operations like network requests, file I/O, or heavy computation.
Concurrency in Swift is implemented through the use of async/await, a new syntax introduced in Swift 5.5. With async/await, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to reason about and maintain.

### Networking with URLSession

In a typical SwiftUI app, you might need to perform network requests to fetch data from a server or API. To do this, we will use URLSession, which is a powerful networking library built into iOS and macOS.
With `URLSession`, you can create a `URLSessionDataTask` to send a GET request to a server, and receive the response in the form of a Data object. Here's an example of how to perform a network request using `URLSession`:

```swift
func fetchData() async throws -> Data { 
  let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")! 
  let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url) 
  guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpResponse.statusCode == 200 else { 
    throw NetworkError.invalidResponse 
  } 
  return data 
}
```

In this example, we create a `URL` object with the URL we want to fetch data from. Then, we create a `URLSessionDataTask` by calling `URLSession.shared.data(from:)` with the `URL` object. The async keyword indicates that this function is asynchronous and can be used with the await keyword.
When the network request is complete, we receive the response in the form of a tuple containing the Data object and the URLResponse. We can then check the status code of the response to make sure it was successful, and return the data if everything is okay.

### Handling Errors with async/await

With async/await, we can also handle errors in a more natural way than with completion handlers or delegates. Here's an example of how to handle errors when fetching data from the network using Concurrency:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error { 
  case invalidResponse 
  case requestFailed(error: Error) 
} 

func fetchData() async throws -> Data { 
  let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")! 
  do { 
    let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url) 
    guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpResponse.statusCode == 200 else { 
      throw NetworkError.invalidResponse 
    } 
    return data 
  } catch { 
    throw NetworkError.requestFailed(error: error) 
  } 
}
```

In this example, we define an enum to represent the possible errors that can occur during the network request. Then, we use a do-catch block to catch any errors that might occur when calling `URLSession.shared.data(from:)`. If an error occurs, we throw a `NetworkError.requestFailed` error instead.

### Working with Data in SwiftUI Views

Now that we know how to fetch data from the network using Concurrency and URLSession, let's see how we can work with that data in a SwiftUI view.
In SwiftUI, we can use the `@State` property wrapper to store the state of our view, and the `@StateObject` or `@ObservedObject` property wrappers to manage the state of our app's data. When the state of a view changes, SwiftUI automatically updates the UI to reflect those changes.
Here's an example of how to fetch data from the network and display it in a SwiftUI view:

```swift
struct ContentView: View { 
  @StateObject private var viewModel = ContentViewModel() 
  var body: some View { 
    VStack { 
      if let title = viewModel.post?.title { 
        Text(title) 
      } else { 
        ProgressView() 
      } 
    } 
    .task { 
      do { 
        try await viewModel.fetchData() 
      } catch { 
        print(error.localizedDescription) 
      }
    }
  }
} 

class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject { 
  @Published var post: Post? 
  func fetchData() async throws { 
    let data = try await NetworkManager.shared.fetchData() 
    post = try JSONDecoder().decode(Post.self, from: data) 
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a ContentView that contains a Text view that displays the title of a post, and a ProgressView that shows a loading indicator while the data is being fetched from the network.
We use a `@StateObject` property wrapper to create an instance of the ContentViewModel, which is responsible for fetching the data and updating the view's state. We also use the task modifier to run the fetchData() method asynchronously when the view is first rendered.
In the ContentViewModel, we use a `@Published` property wrapper to store the Post object that we fetch from the network. When the data is successfully fetched and decoded, we update the post property, which automatically updates the view to display the post's title.
Summary
In this part, we covered the basics of Concurrency and how to use `URLSession` to perform network requests in a SwiftUI app. We also saw how to handle responses and errors with Concurrency's async/await syntax, and how to work with data in SwiftUI views using `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` property wrappers.
In the next part, we will discuss strategies for organizing networking code with Concurrency, and how to use advanced features of Concurrency like handling multiple network requests concurrently and canceling requests.

## Part 2:  Concurrency and SwiftUI

Welcome to Part 2 of our tutorial on Concurrency and SwiftUI! In this part, we will discuss strategies for organizing networking code with Concurrency, and how to use advanced features of Concurrency like handling multiple network requests concurrently and canceling requests.

### Organizing Networking Code

As our app grows in complexity, it becomes more and more important to keep our networking code organized and maintainable. Here are some strategies we can use to keep our networking code organized:

### 1. Separating Concerns

Separating concerns means dividing our networking code into small, modular pieces that each handle a specific responsibility. For example, we might have a NetworkManager class that handles all our network requests, a ResponseParser class that handles parsing JSON responses, and a CacheManager class that handles caching responses.
By separating concerns, we can make our networking code more maintainable and easier to understand. Each class is responsible for one thing, and it's easier to reason about the behavior of each class when its responsibilities are clearly defined.

### 2. Encapsulating Concurrency

Concurrency can make our networking code more complex, but we can encapsulate that complexity to make it easier to manage. For example, we might create a NetworkTask class that encapsulates a network request and its associated state, like whether the request is in progress or has completed.
By encapsulating concurrency in this way, we can simplify our networking code and make it easier to reason about. We can also create higher-level abstractions on top of NetworkTask, like a NetworkOperationQueue that manages a queue of network requests.

### 3. Advanced Concurrency Features

Now that we've covered some strategies for organizing networking code with Concurrency, let's look at some advanced features of Concurrency that can help us write more efficient networking code.

### Concurrent Requests

Concurrency allows us to execute multiple tasks concurrently, which can significantly improve the performance of our app. For example, we might want to fetch data from multiple endpoints in parallel, rather than fetching each endpoint one at a time.
Here's an example of how to fetch data from multiple endpoints concurrently using Concurrency:

```swift
async let postRequest = NetworkManager.shared.fetchData(from: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1") 
async let commentRequest = NetworkManager.shared.fetchData(from: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=1") 
let postData = try await postRequest 
let commentData = try await commentRequest 
let post = try JSONDecoder().decode(Post.self, from: postData) 
let comments = try JSONDecoder().decode([Comment].self, from: commentData) // Do something with post and comments...
```

In this example, we use the async let syntax to start two requests concurrently, one to fetch a post and one to fetch comments for that post. Once both requests have completed, we decode the response data and use the resulting objects in our app.

### Request Cancellation

Sometimes we might want to cancel a network request if it's no longer needed, or if the user has navigated away from the screen that initiated the request. Concurrency allows us to cancel tasks using the `Task.cancel()` method.
Here's an example of how to cancel a network request using Concurrency:

```swift
struct ContentView: View { 
  @StateObject private var viewModel = ContentViewModel() 
  @State private var isRequestCancelled = false 
  var body: some View { 
    VStack { 
      if let title = viewModel.post?.title { 
        Text(title) 
      } else if isRequestCancelled { 
        Text("Request Cancelled") 
      } else { 
        ProgressView() 
      }
    }
    .task { 
      do { 
        try await viewModel.fetchData() 
      } catch { 
        if Task.isCancelled {
          isRequestCancelled = true 
        }
      }
    }
    .onDisappear { 
      Task { 
        await viewModel.cancelRequest() 
      }
    }
  }
}

class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
@Published var post: Post?
private var fetchTask: Task<Void, Error>?
func fetchData() async throws { 
  let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")! 
  let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url) 
  post = try JSONDecoder().decode(Post.self, from: data) 
} 
  func cancelRequest() { 
    fetchTask?.cancel() 
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a `ContentView` that displays the title of a post fetched from an API. We use the `.task` modifier to fetch the post data asynchronously, and we also use the `.onDisappear` modifier to cancel the request if the user navigates away from the screen. The `ContentViewModel` class encapsulates the network request and allows us to cancel it using the `cancelRequest()` method. When the request is cancelled, the `.task` modifier will throw a `CancellationError`, which we catch and use to update the UI. 

### Conclusion and Next Steps 

In this part of our tutorial, we learned strategies for organizing networking code with Concurrency, and how to use advanced features of Concurrency like handling multiple network requests concurrently and canceling requests. In the final part of our tutorial, we will build a sample app that uses Concurrency and SwiftUI to fetch data from an API and display it in a user-friendly way. We will also discuss best practices for using Concurrency in combination with SwiftUI, and provide additional resources for learning more. Stay tuned for Part 3!

## Part 3: Real-World Example

In this part of our tutorial, we will build a sample app that uses Concurrency and SwiftUI to fetch data from an API and display it in a user-friendly way. We will also discuss best practices for using Concurrency in combination with SwiftUI, and provide additional resources for learning more.

### Project Setup

First, let's create a new Xcode project and select the SwiftUI App template. For this example, we will be building an app that displays a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. The app will have two screens: a list of posts, and a detail screen for each post.

### Networking with Concurrency

To fetch data from the API, we will use the `URLSession` class with Concurrency. Let's create a NetworkManager class that will handle our network requests:

```swift
class NetworkManager { 
  private let session: URLSession 
  init() { 
    let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default 
    configuration.timeoutIntervalForResource = 30 
    session = URLSession(configuration: configuration) 
  } 
  func getPosts() async throws -> [Post] { 
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")! 
    let (data, _) = try await session.data(from: url) 
    return try JSONDecoder().decode([Post].self, from: data) 
  } 
}
```

This class has a `getPosts()` method that fetches a list of posts from the API. We use the async keyword to indicate that this method is asynchronous, and we use the await keyword to wait for the network request to complete before returning the result.
SwiftUI Views
Now let's create our SwiftUI views. We'll start with the PostListView:

```swift
struct PostListView: View { 
  @StateObject private var viewModel = PostListViewModel() 
  var body: some View { 
    NavigationView { 
      List(viewModel.posts, id: \.id) { post in NavigationLink(destination: PostDetailView(post: post)) { 
        VStack(alignment: .leading) { 
          Text(post.title) 
          	.font(.headline) 
          Text(post.body) 
          	.font(.subheadline) 
        } 
      }
    } 
    .navigationTitle("Posts") 
    } 
    .task { 
      do { 
        try await viewModel.fetchPosts() 
      } catch { 
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)") 
      } 
    } 
  } 
} 

class PostListViewModel: ObservableObject { 
  @Published var posts = [Post]() 
  private let networkManager = NetworkManager() 
  func fetchPosts() async throws { 
    posts = try await networkManager.getPosts() 
  } 
}
```

In this view, we use the `@StateObject` property wrapper to create a PostListViewModel, which will handle fetching the list of posts from the API. We use the `.task` modifier to run the `fetchPosts()` method asynchronously when the view appears. If an error occurs, we simply print the error to the console.
The PostListViewModel class has a `fetchPosts()` method that uses our NetworkManager class to fetch the list of posts from the API. When the request is complete, we update the posts property of the view model, which triggers an update of the UI.
Next, let's create the PostDetailView:

```swift
struct PostDetailView: View { 
  let post: Post 
  var body: some View { 
    VStack(alignment: .leading) { 
      Text(post.title) 
      .font(.headline) 
      Text(post.body) 
      .font(.subheadline)
    } 
    .padding() 
    .navigationTitle(post.title) 
  } 
}
```

This view simply displays the details of a single post. We pass in a Post object when creating the view, and use its properties to display the post title and body.

### Putting it all Together

Now that we have our views and networking code, let's put them together in our app. We'll modify the ContentView to show the PostListView:

```swift
struct ContentView: View { 
  var body: some View {
    PostListView() 
  } 
}
```

And that's it! Run the app and you should see a list of posts. Tapping on a post will take you to the detail view for that post.

### Best Practices

When using Concurrency with SwiftUI, it's important to follow some best practices to make your code more robust and maintainable:
1. Separate concerns: Split your code into small, reusable components that have a single responsibility. For example, our NetworkManager class handles network requests, while our view models handle the business logic of fetching and updating data.
2. Keep your code readable: Use descriptive names for your variables and functions, and structure your code in a way that makes it easy to read and understand.
3. Avoid common pitfalls: Be aware of common pitfalls when using Concurrency, such as deadlocks, race conditions, and resource leaks. Use Swift's built-in tools, such as `@MainActor` and `@TaskLocal`, to avoid these issues.
4. Test your code: Write unit tests to ensure that your code works as expected, and to catch bugs early.
